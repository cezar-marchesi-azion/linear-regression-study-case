# Linear Regression Study Case

This project is a study case following the [Data Science Academy](https://www.datascienceacademy.com.br/course/machine-learning-em-python-e-c) as source.

---------
For this project we will try to predict the financial return on investments using dummy data, and two different models - first model uses scikit-learn, second model is built from scratch.

For the historical data that will feed and train the model we will use a csv file called dataset.csv with 2 columns: Investment (which refers to the amount invested) and ROI (the ROI generated by the investments).
